Hello, My name's Adyuta.<br>
Im a Linux Enthusiast. And I'm interested in becoming a Full Stack Developer.
  
I really like the world of programming, also related to technology. I spend all my time coding and learning new things. I also like tinkering with Linux Operating Systems, sometimes I like to try and install from parent distro to child distro, and it's really fun for me.
